# Custom Types in Rust

## Structures :

There are three types of structures ("structs") that can be created using the struct keyword:

1. Tuple structs, which are, basically, named tuples.
2. The classic C structs
3. Unit structs, which are field-less, are useful for generics.


## Enums:

The enum keyword allows the creation of a type which may be one of a few different variants. Any variant which is valid as a struct is also valid as an enum.
